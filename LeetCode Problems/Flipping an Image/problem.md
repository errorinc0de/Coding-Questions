Link to Problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/flipping-an-image/

Type: Easy

Statement:

Given an n x n binary matrix image, flip the image horizontally, then invert it, and return the resulting image.

To flip an image horizontally means that each row of the image is reversed.

- For example, flipping [1,1,0] horizontally results in [0,1,1].

To invert an image means that each 0 is replaced by 1, and each 1 is replaced by 0.

- For example, inverting [0,1,1] results in [1,0,0].
