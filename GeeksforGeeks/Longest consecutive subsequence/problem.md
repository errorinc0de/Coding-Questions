## Longest consecutive subsequence
**Medium**
Given an array of positive integers. Find the length of the longest sub-sequence such that elements in the subsequence are consecutive integers, the **consecutive numbers can be in any order.**  

**Example 1:**
**Input:** 
N = 7
a[] = {2,6,1,9,4,5,3}
**Output:** 6 

**Example 2:**
**Input:** 
N = 7
a[] = {1,9,3,10,4,20,2}
**Output:** 4 

  
**Your Task:**  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function **findLongestConseqSubseq()** which takes the array arr[] and the size of the array as inputs and returns the length of the longest subsequence of consecutive integers.

  
**Expected Time Complexity:** O(N).  
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(N).

  
**Constraints:**  
1 <= N <= 105  
0 <= a[i] <= 105
